# django-blog

Welcome to the **django-blog** project! This project demonstrates the creation of a Django-based blog with various features including database-backed storage, cloud image hosting, custom authentication, and enhanced interactivity using JavaScript. The project is deployed on Heroic, with a PostgreSQL for the database to store comments, posts & likes and Cloudinary for image storage.

1. **Create a database-backed Django project & deploy it to Heroku**
2. **Host upload images on a cloud provider (Cloudinary)**
3. **Create function-based views in a Django project**
4. **Use built-in Django generic views**
5. **Add an authentication back-end and create custom database models**
6. **Add extra interactivity with JavaScript**

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework
- **Heroku**: Deployment platform
- ** **: PostgreSQL database service
- **Cloudinary**: Image storage and hosting
- **JavaScript**: For enhanced interactivity

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
